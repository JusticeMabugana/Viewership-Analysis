# Viewership-EDAðŸ“º

## Introduction

* The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate our Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Viewership dataset using Python

* This dataset offers insights into viewing habits across multiple platforms, detailing which shows customers watched, the duration of viewing, the dates of viewing, and whether the shows were watched live or on-demand.
